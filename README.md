#Eternal Blue

This is my walkthrough of the Blue box that you can attempt on TryHackMe.  This room explores the notorious Eternal Blue exploit developed by the NSA.  Officially known as MS17-010 by Microsoft, Eternal blue affects Windows operating systems that use the SMBv1 (Server Message Block Version 1) file-sharing protocol.  Windows operating systems are amongst the most commonly used accross corporations for enterprise use & amongst individuals for personal use making this a huge threat. 

This exploit became notorious becaue of its use in the infamous NotPetya & WannaCry cyber attacks that occured in 2016 & 2017 and unfortunately is still used today against vulnerable machines.   This walkthrough will show you how to identify a vulnerable machine, exploit that vulnerability using Eternal Blue, gain access, and enumerate.
